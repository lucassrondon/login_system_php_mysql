This is a login system with a simple CRUD using php and mysql.

To test the system you will have to:

1. Go to the file "db_connection.php" and change the server info to your server's info. 

2. Create two tables for strings in your data base:
    One table called "contact_info" with 5 columns(email, firstname, lastname, phone, emailform)
    Another table called "login_info" with 3 columns(email, username, password)
